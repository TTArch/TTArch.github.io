I am a Master's student at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https.www.ruc.edu.cn/), where I am a member of the [ALOHA Lab](https://aloha.show/) advised by Prof. [Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing** and **Autonomous Agents**, with a focus on building intelligent systems that can understand, reason, and interact with the world.
